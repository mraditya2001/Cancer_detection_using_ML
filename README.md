# Cancer_detection_using_ML
 "Our Python/Jupyter cancer detection project uses ML (SVMs, RF, or CNNs) to classify tumors (malignant/benign) from medical images. We preprocess data, train models, and optimize hyperparameters using scikit-learn/TensorFlow. Evaluation metrics include accuracy, precision, recall."Click on ML_Cancer_prediction
